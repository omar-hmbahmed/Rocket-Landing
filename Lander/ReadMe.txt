Lander Simulator

Version 1    Assumes thrust = 0, drag = 0, mass is constant, and simulator has constant acceleration
Run Lander.m


Version 2    Assumes thrust = constant, drag = 0, mass is constant, and simulator has constant acceleration
Run Lander.m


Version 3    Assumes thrust = constant, drag = 0, variable mass, and variable acceleration
Run Lander.m


Version 4    Assumes thrust = constant, variable drag, variable mass, and variable acceleration
Run Lander.m

Version 5    Includes controller wiht constant gain and desired velocity of zero
Run Lander.m

Version 6    Improved figures by adding gain to the title and adding horizontal vdesired line. CheckCriteria function added to analyse key values
Run Lander.m

Version 7    Linear desired velocity has been implemented.
Run Lander.m

Version 8    Piecewise linear function for desired velocity has been implemented.
Run Lander.m

Version 9    Implements the new script of investigatePWLs.m
Run investigatePWLs.m
